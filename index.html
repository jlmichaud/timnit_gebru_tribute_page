        <h2>Expertise</h2>
        <p>Dr. Timnit Gebru is a highly respected computer scientist specializing in artificial intelligence (AI). She has made numerous <a href="https://thegradient.pub/the-far-reaching-impacts-of-timnit-gebru/">groundbreaking contributions</a> to the the fields of computer vision and AI ethics.<p>
        
        <p>Gebru is a founding member of <a href="https://blackinai.github.io/#/ " >Black in AI</a>, a community of black researchers working in artificial intelligence. A tireless advocate for the inclusion of more BIPOC in the field of machine learning, Dr. Gebru has also sounded the alarm regarding AI's harmful impacts on people of colour especially with regard to facial recognition software.</p>
  
        <h2>Google research</h2>
        <p>In 2020, as co-lead of Google's Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team,  she completed a co-authored research paper  that examined the impacts of Google's large language models. Some of the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/" >issues the research addressed</a> included: 
          <ul>
            <li>the environmental and financial impacts of training large AI models</li>
            <li>the impossibility of auditing the massive amount of input that the AI models are trained on which include racist, sexist and otherwise harmful content </li>
            <li>the potential for AI models to be used to generate dangerous misinformation campaigns</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
  
        <p>In December 2020, Google asked that Gebru withdraw the paper. Dr. Gebru responded saying that she would only continue working for Google if certain conditions were met. She was immediately fired, with Google stating that they had accepted her resignation (though no resignation had been given).</p>
        
        <p>In the aftermath, Gebru received a great deal of public support. An <a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382" >open letter</a> was signed by thousands of Google employees, as well as academic, industry and civil society supporters. However she was also the target of an intense <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean" >harassment campaign</a>.</p>

              "This is also a moment of reckoning beyond Google. As we know, Dr. Gebru is one of the few people exerting pressure from the inside against the unethical and undemocratic incursion of powerful and biased technologies into our daily lives. This is a public service, and its importance cannot be overstated. Googleâ€™s retaliation against Dr. Gebru, and its move to silence this work, concerns us all."
